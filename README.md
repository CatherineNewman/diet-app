# diet-app
App for keto/LCH/banting. Tracking, food lookups, graphs

Suggestions from the community:
1.  Adjust macros by grams as well as percentage
    e.g. if adjusting carbs to 20g, recalculate percentage of fat and protein
2.  Graph of weightloss over time (period selectable)
3. Trend line on graph
4. Track menstrual cycle dates
5. Notes for the day
6. Keep user-entered data in a separate table so that the main table does not contain incorrect data
7. Ability to set target macros by day or for a special day
8. Only display net carbs - total confuses newbies
